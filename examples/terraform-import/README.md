The terraform import command is used to import existing resources into Terraform. This allows you to take resources that youâ€™ve created by some other means and bring them under Terraform management.

Note that terraform import DOES NOT generate configuration, it only modifies state. You'll still need to write a configuration block for the resource for which it will be mapped using the terraform import command.
