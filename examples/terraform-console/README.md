The terraform console command provides an interactive console for evaluating expressions.

The Terraform console allows you to experiment with Terraform interpolations.
You may access resources in the state (if you have one) just as you would
from a configuration. For example: "aws_instance.foo.id" would evaluate
to the ID of "aws_instance.foo" if it exists in your state.

Type in the interpolation to test and hit <enter> to see the result.

To exit the console, type "exit" and hit <enter>, or use Control-C or
Control-D.
